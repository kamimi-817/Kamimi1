                <p><strong>The Birth of Takao-kami-no-Kami:</strong> Takao-kami-no-Kami is the water kami born when Kagutsuchi, the kami of fire, was cut down. According to Japanese mythology, when Izanagi-no-Mikoto cut Kagutsuchi, various kami were born from the blood. One of these was Takao-kami-no-Kami, who was born to suppress the power of fire by becoming a water kami.</p>
                <p><strong>Relation to Kuraokami:</strong> The Takao-kami-no-Kami enshrined at Kifune Shinto Shrine is also known as Kuraokami. According to the shrine records, "though the names are different, they are the same kami." One theory suggests that Takao-kami-no-Kami is a "dragon deity of the mountaintop," while Kuraokami is the "dragon deity of the valley depths." Both are water kami, and as water is the source of all life, they play an important role in maintaining the balance of nature as "kami of the water source."</p>
