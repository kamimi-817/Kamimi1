        <h1>Visiting Etiquette</h1>
        <div class="bunsyou">
            <p>In this section, we will explain the etiquette for visiting Kifune Shinto Shrine. A shrine is the home of kami, so approach your visit with the same respect as if you were visiting the home of a respected elder. Follow the steps below to ensure a proper visit and avoid showing any disrespect to kami.</p>
        
            <h2>Procedure and Order for Visiting Kifune Shinto Shrine</h2>
            <h3>Overall Visiting Procedure</h3>
            <p>When visiting a shrine, first pass through the torii gate, then cleanse your hands and mouth at the temizuya. Afterward, offer your prayers in front of the main hall and quietly exit the shrine grounds.</p>
        
            <h3>Three Shrine Visit (Sanshamoude)</h3>
            <p>The official way to visit Kifune Shinto Shrine is called "Sanshamoude," where you visit three different shrine buildings in the following order:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Main Shrine (Hongu):</strong> Start your visit at the Main Shrine, which enshrines Takaokami no Kami. There is also a detailed explanation page about Takaokami no Kami, so be sure to check it out.</li>
                <li><strong>Inner Shrine (Okunomiya):</strong> About a five-minute walk from the Main Shrine, this shrine also enshrines Takaokami no Kami. The Inner Shrine is known to be a place where the shrine's spiritual power is concentrated. It is also deeply associated with the worship of Funadama no Kami. Some believe that Kurakami no Kami and Tamayorihime no Mikoto are also enshrined here.</li>
                <li><strong>Yui Shrine:</strong> Finally, visit Yui Shrine, which is located between the Main Shrine and Inner Shrine, and enshrines Iwanaga Hime no Mikoto, known as the kami of matchmaking.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is believed that by visiting in this order, your wishes will be granted.</p>
        
            <h2>How to Pass Through the Torii Gate</h2>
            <p>The torii gate marks the entrance to a sacred place. Follow the steps below to properly pass through the torii gate.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Stop in front of the torii:</strong> Before entering the shrine, pause in front of the torii gate.</li>
                <li><strong>Bow:</strong> Bow in the direction of the shrine to show respect before entering.</li>
                <li><strong>Pass through the torii:</strong> When passing through, avoid walking in the center and walk along the side instead.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <h2>How to Walk</h2>
            <p>Within the shrine grounds, it is customary to walk on the left side, avoiding the center, which is believed to be where kami pass. Show respect by walking slightly to the side and keep quiet, so as not to disturb other visitors.</p>
        
            <h2>Temizu (Cleansing Ritual)</h2>
            <p>When you arrive at the temizuya, bow slightly before beginning. Follow these steps to cleanse your hands and mouth.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Use the ladle to pour water over your left hand.</li>
                <li>Next, cleanse your right hand.</li>
                <li>Take water into your left hand again and rinse your mouth with it. Be sure not to touch the ladle directly to your mouth.</li>
                <li>After rinsing your mouth, cleanse your left hand once more.</li>
                <li>Finally, hold the ladle vertically and let the remaining water flow over the handle, then return the ladle to its place.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <h2>How to Offer Prayers (Haiden)</h2>
            <p>When you reach the front of the haiden (main prayer hall), follow these steps to offer your prayers.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Bow lightly and, if there is a bell, ring it.</li>
                <li>Place your offering into the offering box.</li>
                <li>Bow deeply twice.</li>
                <li>Clap your hands twice.</li>
                <li>While making your wish, silently recite your name and address and express your gratitude.</li>
                <li>Bow deeply once more.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <h2>How to Walk When Leaving</h2>
            <p>After completing your visit, walk along the side of the path as you exit. It is considered more polite to walk on the "left side from the shrine's perspective."</p>
        
            <h2>How to Pass Through the Torii Gate (When Leaving)</h2>
            <p>Follow these steps when passing through the torii gate upon leaving:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pass through the torii gate.</li>
                <li>Turn your body toward the shrine.</li>
                <li>Bow.</li>
                <li>Turn your body back toward the exit and leave.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <p>When visiting a shrine, never forget to approach with the same humility as if you were visiting the home of someone superior to you. Show respect and offer your prayers with the correct etiquette, and the kami will hear your wishes.</p>
