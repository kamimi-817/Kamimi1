        <h1>Worship Etiquette</h1>
<div class="bunsyou">
    <p>In this section, we will explain the etiquette for visiting a Shinto shrine. A Shinto shrine is the home of the kami. Therefore, you should approach your visit with the mindset of visiting the home of someone highly respected. By following the steps below, aim to worship with proper etiquette and avoid showing disrespect to the kami.</p>

    <h2>1. General Flow of Worship</h2>
    <p>When visiting a Shinto shrine, first pass through the torii gate, then purify your hands and mouth at the temizuya (purification fountain). After that, offer your prayers in front of the main hall, and finally, quietly exit the Shinto shrine precincts.</p>

    <h2>2. How to Pass Through the Torii Gate</h2>
    <p>The torii gate marks the entrance to a sacred space. Please follow these steps when passing through the torii gate:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Bow in front of the torii: Before entering the Shinto shrine, stop briefly in front of the torii.</li>
        <li>Bow towards the main hall: Bow once in the direction of the main hall before entering the Shinto shrine, as a sign of respect.</li>
        <li>Pass through the torii: When passing through the torii, avoid walking in the center and proceed along the sides.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How to Walk</h2>
    <p>Inside the Shinto shrine precincts, it is customary to avoid the center and walk on the left side. The center is believed to be the path of the kami, so walking slightly to the side shows respect. Walk quietly and be mindful not to disturb other worshippers.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Highest rank: the center.</li>
        <li>Higher rank: from the Shinto shrine's perspective, the left side (the right side as you approach the Shinto shrine).</li>
        <li>Lower rank: from the Shinto shrine's perspective, the right side (the left side as you approach the Shinto shrine).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Those who haven't yet worshiped should walk on the "right side from the Shinto shrine's perspective (left side as you approach)," and those who have already worshiped should walk on the "left side from the Shinto shrine's perspective (right side as you approach)." This is a more polite way of walking.</p>

    <h2>4. Temizu (Purification)</h2>
    <p>When you reach the temizuya, bow lightly and follow these steps to purify your hands and mouth:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Scoop water with the ladle and cleanse your left hand.</li>
        <li>Next, cleanse your right hand.</li>
        <li>Take water in your left hand again, and use it to rinse your mouth (do not bring the ladle directly to your mouth).</li>
        <li>After rinsing your mouth, cleanse your left hand again.</li>
        <li>Finally, tilt the ladle upright to let the remaining water wash over the handle, then return the ladle to its original place.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>5. How to Offer Worship</h2>
    <p>When you arrive in front of the main hall, follow these steps to offer your worship:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bow lightly and, if available, ring the bell.</li>
        <li>Place a monetary offering in the offering box.</li>
        <li>Bow deeply twice (two bows).</li>
        <li>Clap your hands twice (two claps).</li>
        <li>When making a wish, follow these steps:
            <ul>
                <li>Introduce yourself: In your heart, state your name and address to let the kami know who you are.</li>
                <li>Express gratitude: Thank the kami for the blessings you have received.</li>
                <li>Make your wish: Be as specific as possible with your wish. The more specific you are, the clearer your request will be to the kami, and it will also help organize your own thoughts. You might say something like, "I will work hard, so please guide me in the right direction."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bow deeply once again (one final bow).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>6. How to Walk on the Way Back</h2>
    <p>After you have finished worshiping, walk along the side of the approach path on your way back as well. It is recommended to walk on the "left side from the Shinto shrine's perspective (right side as you approach)." Many worshippers going to the Shinto shrine will be walking on the "right side from the Shinto shrine's perspective (left side as you approach)," so be mindful to avoid collisions.</p>

    <h2>7. How to Pass Through the Torii (On the Way Back)</h2>
    <p>When leaving, follow these steps for passing through the torii:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Pass through the torii.</li>
        <li>Turn to face the Shinto shrine.</li>
        <li>Bow (you bow after passing through the torii).</li>
        <li>Turn back and continue on your way.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When visiting a Shinto shrine, always remember to approach with the humble mindset of visiting the home of someone highly respected. By showing respect and worshiping with the proper etiquette, the kami will listen to your wishes.</p>
